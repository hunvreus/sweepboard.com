      <h2>Why Octokan?</h2>
      <p>We love GitHub, but its issue queue can get messy:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Issues get buried</strong> and people tend to focus more on the newest issues.</li>
        <li><strong>It's hard to prioritize</strong> when issues are displayed as a flat list.</li>
        <li><strong>Navigating issues is cumbersome</strong>. Switching threads and adding new issues quickly turn into page refresh galore.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Give Octokan a spin, <a href='app.octokan.com/#/board?login'>log in with your GitHub account</a>.</p>
