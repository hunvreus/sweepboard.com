<ol>
<li><p><strong>Your SweepBoard.com Account and Site.</strong> If you log in the Website, you are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and you are fully responsible for all activities that occur under the account and any other actions taken in connection with your account. You must not describe or assign keywords to your issues in a misleading or unlawful manner, including in a manner intended to trade on the name or reputation of others, and Wiredcraft may change or remove any description or keyword that it considers inappropriate or unlawful, or otherwise likely to cause Wiredcraft liability.

Wiredcraft will not be liable for any acts or omissions by You, including any damages of any kind incurred as a result of such acts or omissions.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Responsibility of Contributors.</strong> If you create an issue, edit an issue, comment on an issue, link to an issue, close an issue, open an issue, link to any external website, label an issue, or otherwise make (or allow any third party to make) material available by means of the Website (any such material, “Content”), You are entirely responsible for the content of, and any harm resulting from, that Content. That is the case regardless of whether the Content in question constitutes text, graphics, an audio file, or computer software. By making Content available, you represent and warrant that:</p>
<ul>

<li>the Content does not contain or install any viruses, worms, malware, Trojan horses or other harmful or destructive content;</li>
<li>the Content is not spam, is not machine- or randomly-generated, and does not contain unethical or unwanted commercial content designed to drive traffic to third party sites or boost the search engine rankings of third party sites, or to further unlawful acts (such as phishing) or mislead recipients as to the source of the material (such as spoofing);</li>

</li>
<li><p><strong>Disclaimer of Warranties.</strong> The Website is provided “as is”. Wiredcraft and its suppliers and licensors hereby disclaim all warranties of any kind, express or implied, including, without limitation, the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement.

</li>
<li><p><strong>Limitation of Liability.</strong> In no event will Wiredcraft, or its suppliers or licensors, be liable with respect to any subject matter of this agreement under any contract, negligence, strict liability or other legal or equitable theory for: (i) any special, incidental or consequential damages; (ii) the cost of procurement for substitute products or services; (iii) for interruption of use or loss or corruption of data; or (iv) for any amounts that exceed the fees paid by you to Wiredcraft under this agreement during the twelve (12) month period prior to the cause of action. Wiredcraft shall have no liability for any failure or delay due to matters beyond their reasonable control. The foregoing shall not apply to the extent prohibited by applicable law.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>General Representation and Warranty.</strong> You represent and warrant that (i) your use of the Website will be in strict accordance with the Wiredcraft Privacy Policy, with this Agreement and with all applicable laws and regulations (including without limitation any local laws or regulations in your country, state, city, or other governmental area, regarding online conduct and acceptable content, and including all applicable laws regarding the transmission of technical data exported from the United States or the country in which you reside) and (ii) your use of the Website will not infringe or misappropriate the intellectual property rights of any third party.</p>

</li>
<li><p><strong>Miscellaneous.</strong> This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between Wiredcraft and you concerning the subject matter hereof, and they may only be modified by a written amendment signed by an authorized executive of Wiredcraft, or by the posting by Wiredcraft of a revised version. Except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise, this Agreement, any access to or use of the Website will be governed by the laws of the state of California, U.S.A., excluding its conflict of law provisions, and the proper venue for any disputes arising out of or relating to any of the same will be the state and federal courts located in San Francisco County, California. Except for claims for injunctive or equitable relief or claims regarding intellectual property rights (which may be brought in any competent court without the posting of a bond), any dispute arising under this Agreement shall be finally settled in accordance with the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules of the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Service, Inc. (“JAMS”) by three arbitrators appointed in accordance with such Rules. The arbitration shall take place in San Francisco, California, in the English language and the arbitral decision may be enforced in any court. The prevailing party in any action or proceeding to enforce this Agreement shall be entitled to costs and attorneys’ fees. If any part of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable, that part will be construed to reflect the parties’ original intent, and the remaining portions will remain in full force and effect. A waiver by either party of any term or condition of this Agreement or any breach thereof, in any one instance, will not waive such term or condition or any subsequent breach thereof. You may assign your rights under this Agreement to any party that consents to, and agrees to be bound by, its terms and conditions; Wiredcraft may assign its rights under this Agreement without condition. This Agreement will be binding upon and will inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.</p>
